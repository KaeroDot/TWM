Bugs:
 - It seems there is something fishy about loader of shunt correction data. It probably loads incorrect uncertainty.
 - It seems 1-input algs. calculates time shift correction differently then 2-input algs. -> bug most likely in the alg. executer

Digitizers panel:
 - hide selector of DMM idn - confusing


Doc:
