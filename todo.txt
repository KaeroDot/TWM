Bugs:
 - deletion of old record files may offer to delete all drives when TWM run with currupted config.ini!

Dunnows:
 - possibly wrong timestamp processing for two input algorithms (was fixed for TWM-WFFT), need to change correction from U channel to I channel, so maybe the same for PWRFFT and PWRTDI! The sign was ok, but when subrecords are processed, it must be fixed.

Todo:
 - temperature logging for multiplexing mode not implemented!
