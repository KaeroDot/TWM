Bugs:
 - plot viewer ignores amplitude display mode?
 - export to XLS different than in result viewer

Dunnows:
 - possibly wrong timestamp processing for two input algorithms (was fixed for TWM-WFFT), need to change correction from U channel to I channel, so maybe the same for PWRFFT and PWRTDI! The sign was ok, but when subrecords are processed, it must be fixed.

Todo:
 - temperature logging for multiplexing mode not implemented!
