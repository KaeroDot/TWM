Bugs:

Dunnows:
 - possibly wrong timestamp processing for two input algorithms (was fixed for TWM-WFFT), need to change correction from U channel to I channel, so maybe the same for PWRFFT and PWRTDI! The sign was ok, but when subrecords are processed, it must be fixed.

Todo:
 - temperature logging for multiplexing mode not implemented!
 - Octave/Matlab loads all '\octprog' subfolders, so it always uses \octprog\qwtb instead of the path given in config panel. This should be fixed.
 - Warnings from transdcucers panel shows as errors in main panel?
 - sometimes changed digitizer channels count does not reflect in tranducers panel
 - do not show phase/channel index when only one phase/channel available
