function [diC] = matrices_to_cells(din) %<<<1
% Reorder data from the Cell diC of size N with structures with matrices to a
% Strucure with matrices of one dimension more. The added dimension will have
% size N.
% This is done with respect to the qwtb and TWM quantities, so parameter
% dimensions are not increased.
% If matrices diC{i}.Q.F and diC{j}.Q.F are not of same dimensions, they are
% padded by NaNs to the size of larger one.
% Structures in cells must have the same fields to whole depth.


% Reorder data from a structure with matrices of dimension N+1 into cells of structures
% with matrices of dimension N. The last dimension was used for different phases of the sampled system.
% This is done with respect to the qwtb and TWM quantities, so parameter
% dimensions are not increased.
% Script qwtb_exec_algorithm.m did the conversion from cell of structs to
% struct of N+1 matrices. If matrices were of incompatible sizes, padding by
% NaNs occured.
